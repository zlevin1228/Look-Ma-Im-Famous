          In early 1920, Halas received a call from the Staley Starch Works,
          based in Decatur, IL. The Staley company wondered if Halas would
          relocate to that central Illinois city to work at the company, as
          well as organize and coach the company's football and baseball
          teams. Halas jumped at the opportunity. The new manager and coach of
          the Decatur Staleys, and his partner Ed "Dutch" Sternaman, decided
          it would be best to attend an organizational meeting of other club
          team owners that September in Canton, OH. The group formed the
          rudimentary structure of the American Professional Football
          Association, to be renamed the National Football League in 1924.
          Following a successful 1920 season, A.E. Staley met with Halas in
          Decatur, and told the young coach of his team that unfortunately he
          didn't think a professional football team could survive in Decatur.
          Take your team to Chicago, young man, Staley said. He offered Halas
          $5,000 to get started in exchange for keeping the team named the
          Staleys for one season. Halas indeed moved the team to Chicago, and
          thanks to the goodwill of Chicago Cubs owner William Veeck Sr., the
          Chicago Staleys began a 70-year run of sharing Wrigley Field for a
          portion of the gate, concessions and program sales. Feeling somewhat
          in debt to Veeck, in 1922 Halas renamed the Staleys the Bears, in
          honor of the Cubs.

          During his incredible career he filled the shoes of owner, manager,
          player, and promoter, and was an influential leader among the NFL’s
          ownership. It was, however, as a coach that he excelled and was best
          known. Although Halas coached his Bears for 40 seasons, he stepped
          away from the coaching ranks three times – 1930-1932, 1942-1945 (to
          serve in the military), and 1956-1957. Each time a rejuvenated Halas
          returned to the sidelines to coach and won an NFL championship.
          Twice, in 1934 and 1942, Halas’ teams had undefeated regular-season
          records. His 318 regular-season wins and 324 total victories were
          long-standing NFL records until broken by Don Shula in 1993. His
          Chicago Bears teams won six NFL titles, the first coming in 1921
          after the Staleys moved to Chicago. George's Bears won three other
          divisional titles and finished second 15 times. Only six of Halas'
          40 teams finished below the .500 mark. As a coach, Halas was first
          in many ways: the first to hold daily practice sessions, to utilize
          films of opponents' games for study, to schedule a barnstorming
          tour, and to have his team's games broadcast on radio. With his
          players, George maintained tight control. Disobedience and
          insubordination were not tolerated. Along with Ralph Jones, his
          coach from 1930 through 1932, and consultant Clark Shaughnessy,
          Halas perfected the T-formation attack with the man in motion. It
          was this destructive force that propelled the Bears to their
          stunning 73-0 NFL title win over Washington in the 1940 NFL
          Championship Game and sent every other league team scurrying to copy
          the Halas system.
